# Phase-3-Project-Classification-Problem
# Chicago Car Crash Severity Prediction
# Overview
This project utilizes machine learning to predict the likelihood of severity of car crashes in Chicago, based on factors like weather conditions, vehicle speed, traffic control devices & Lighting conditions. The goal is to assist traffic authorities in identifying potentially high-risk accidents, improving resource allocation, and enhancing public safety.
# Dataset
The Dataset is sourced from the Chicago data portal
# Model Details
The classification models used are Logistic Regression & Random Forest Classifier models
# Evaluation Metrics
The evaluation matrix used include Precision, recall, Accuracy & Confusion Matrix

# Results
The results obtained has the model predict between 48 & 51% of the target variable
